# RayTracingMirrors

![Functional Diagram for YFinance Processor](/outputrays.png "Functional/topology Diagram")

This is a draft-like code, which arose from a friend's request
to try to estimate the focal point of a beam of light after
hitting 3 mirrors. 

In the code one may create the 3 different mirrors, the initial position
and aperture of the beam, hence, by visualization, one 
is able to fine-tune the mirror's positions, given the beam's 
characteristics, in order to create and estimate a focal point.

This is depicted in the figure above.
